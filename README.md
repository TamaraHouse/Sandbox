# Sandbox
This is my repository to test how github works and if and how I can use it for coding and non-coding projects.
All things in this repository are just tests, probably never useful for anyone

So who am I? 
I'm a scientist and a teacher, interested in biology, education and development of transversal (soft) skills.

Why GitHub?
Why not? Looking for a way to collaborate with others on diverse projects and this might be a good and easy way.
